# South Side Infoviz

Web application that visualizes information about the Futurice South Side tribe.

Made with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

Live demo with mock data: [southside-infoviz.divshot.io](http://southside-infoviz.divshot.io/)


## Setting up

Run these commands in the project directory:

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

## Usage

The project scaffold is based on the Yeoman [polymer-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer). Development files are in `app` and production files in `dist`.

You can start watching files, and boot up a server with BrowserSync (think LiveReload in steroids) enabled with

```gulp serve```
